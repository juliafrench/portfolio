<p>After receiving my BA at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I moved to Chicago and began my career at Showtime Networks, working as promotions coordinator for premium cable services. I then went to work as a copywriter for a 
startup firm called VideOcart, a B2C startup that designed, installed, and operated a nationwide system of 22,000 wireless PDAs
on shopping carts.</p>  

<p> After earning an MA in Writing at DePaul University and relocating to Milwaukee, I taught writing and composition at the 
University of Milwaukee-Wisconsin, Concordia University, and Milwaukee Area Technical College.</p>

<p>I then fulfilled a lifelong dream and moved to Anchorage, Alaska, in 1995. I worked in a variety of editorial roles: I wrote policies 
and procedures for the Municipality of Anchorage, Department of Public Works;  I wrote Invitations to Bid and RFPs for construction projects for
the Alaska Court System Project Office; taught technical writing and research at the University of Alaska; and served as an affiliate editor for the <i> Alaska Quarterly Review</i>, an award-winning literary journal.</p>
 
<p>In 2000, I relocated to Seattle, Washington, and worked as a technical editor for AT&amp;T Wireless for five years, and then 
as a contract technical writer for Boeing.  I currently do editorial contract work for a variety of freelance clients, including Humanities Software.
